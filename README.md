# Cloned tiktik

cloned tiktik for fun!


Thinking of the Final project,I had been tinkering alot around what should I learn? Which tech stack?


I came across a bunch of react video tuturials and found it interesting!
So interesting that after I learned all this react code , I ended up with an internship at at company as a front end developer!
Do checkout me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishaan-rajpal-6a3834244/).

Zhang Yiming,the founder of ByteDance always fascinated me about how his journey began and how first they
were a personalized news company,then they began to search the best and quickest way a human grasp's knowledge and
found it with short videos.

I found it interesting so I decided to make a clone and made one in about a month.

I used Typescript(javacript + types) because it is so becoming so much in demand these days. 
I loved using tailwindcss , it really made me feel a lot better than dealing with sass/css files.
I used nextjs for quick backend and sanity for quick database.
I decided to have a search area,a profile area and like/comment button and made it fast as to upload the
video in a while.
I learned so much that I think I am ready to have a career as a software engineer thanks to CS50.
